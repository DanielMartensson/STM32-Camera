# STM32 Ethernet camera

This project have:

 * CAN-bus
 * Encoder
 * Input capture
 * DAC 12-bit
 * ADC 12-bit
 * Digital N-channel output
 * Digital input
 * FSCM 16-Bit LCD
 * DCMI camera
 * Ethernet

This project have some issues with

 * OV7670 Camera SCCB protocol (Need more work to get I2C work with SCCB)
 * Ethernet for STM32F4 series (I think there is a bug in STM32CubeIDE)
